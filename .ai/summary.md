## Modules

Confidence is computed from evidence, not copied from the manifest: `verified` =
declared and corroborated by discovered code, `documented` = declared with no code to
check against, `derived` = discovered with no declaration.

| Module | Path | Owner | Purpose | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `analytics-ai-engine` | `packages/ai-engine` | AI Engineering | Run the documented analytics agents over evidence packages built from verified data, behind a provider abstraction so no single vendor is load-bearing. | `verified` |
| `analytics-api` | `apps/api` | Backend | Serve the inventory diagnostic over HTTP: resolve fail-closed tenant and membership context, ingest and version tenant-owned datasets, normalize them into the canonical transaction model, enforce tenant-scoped role-based access, and expose analytics, reconciliation, export, and preview-only logistics import mapping and quality surfaces. Logistics persistence remains gated. | `verified` |
| `analytics-data-quality` | `packages/data-quality` | Data | Score incoming customer data, propose and apply cleansing, and normalize ambiguous values such as dates so downstream analytics receive evidence-tagged input. | `verified` |
| `analytics-deployment` | `scripts/deployment` | DevOps | Carry out staged deployment and its safety operations — preflight checks, database backup and restore, rollback, and post-deploy smoke tests. Executing any of these against a real environment is a protected action requiring approval. | `verified` |
| `analytics-engine` | `packages/analytics-engine` | Data | Compute the inventory analytics the product sells — ABC, XYZ, aging, consumption, excess, shortage, health, forecasting and planning — as pure functions over canonical transactions. | `verified` |
| `analytics-fixtures` | `scripts` | Data | Generate synthetic UAT and demonstration datasets so the platform can be exercised without customer data. | `verified` |
| `analytics-kaaf-tooling` | `scripts/architecture` | DevOps | Generate and validate this repository's KAAF architecture context. Vendored from Islamce/KAAF; see VENDORED.md before changing anything here. | `verified` |
| `analytics-logistics-engine` | `packages/logistics-engine` | Data | Compute bounded Logistics Intelligence metrics as pure, evidence-oriented functions without owning warehouse execution, project/WBS truth, or transport execution. | `verified` |
| `analytics-runtime-entry` | `.` | DevOps | Start the production process: boot the API, which also serves the built web SPA, under the PM2 configuration used on the managed host. | `verified` |
| `analytics-shared-types` | `packages/shared-types` | Backend | Define the types, canonical transaction vocabulary, and the single role-to-permission matrix that every other module in the platform shares. | `verified` |
| `analytics-web` | `apps/web` | Frontend | Present the inventory, data-quality, reconciliation, analytics, planning, AI, reports, administration and audit workspaces to users as a React SPA served by the API in production. | `verified` |

## External integrations

| Integration | Module | Criticality | On unavailability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic API | `analytics-ai-engine` | optional | AI agents return a controlled error; every non-AI analytics surface is unaffected. |
| OpenAI API | `analytics-ai-engine` | optional | AI agents return a controlled error; every non-AI analytics surface is unaffected. |
| Knex relational database (SQLite in development; PostgreSQL and MySQL adapters for hosted environments) | `analytics-api` | required | The API cannot serve or ingest any dataset. Production startup refuses SQLite. |
| PM2 | `analytics-runtime-entry` | required | The production process is not supervised; a crash is not restarted automatically. |

## Drift — declared versus discovered

0 error, 0 warning, 2 info. Errors block CI; warnings and information do not.

| Severity | Type | Module | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `info` | `large-public-surface` | `analytics-logistics-engine` | 13 public symbols at the entry points (guideline is 10). |
| `info` | `large-public-surface` | `analytics-shared-types` | 52 public symbols at the entry points (guideline is 10). |

Full detail, with evidence and recommendations, in `.ai/drift.json`.

## How to use this

1. Read `.ai/ai-context.json` for the module index and conventions.
2. Read this summary for orientation.
3. Read `.ai/modules/<id>.json` for the module your task touches.
4. Check `.ai/drift.json` before trusting a declaration.
5. Open only the source files those steps referenced.

Declarations come from `kaaf.repo.json` and `kaaf.module.json`. Discovery is a static
read of the source: dynamic imports and runtime wiring are invisible to it, so the
absence of a drift finding is not proof that none exists.
